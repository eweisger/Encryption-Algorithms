Homework 2: Cryptography - 2/18/19
-----------------------------------------------------
Getting the decrypted message, making my own keys, and re-encryting it:

To get the public key:
openssl rsa -in task4_private.pem -out task4_public.pem -outform PEM -pubout

To get the decryption key:
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey task4_private.pem -in key.bin.enc -out task4_key.bin

To decrypt task4_encrypted_message.dat:
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in task4_encrypted_message.dat -out task4_decrypted_message.txt -pass file:./task4_key.bin

Generated my own private key:
openssl genrsa -des3 -out my_private.pem 2048
with pass phrase: mushi

Got my public key:
openssl rsa -in my_private.pem -out my_public.pem -outform PEM -pubout
with pass phrase: mushi

Got my random key: 
openssl rand -hex 64 > mykey.bin

Re-encrypted the decrypted message with my random key:
openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -salt -in task4_decrypted_message.txt -out task4_decrypted_message.txt.enc -pass file:./mykey.bin

Encrypted my random key with my public key:
openssl rsautl -encrypt -inkey my_public.pem -pubin -in mykey.bin -out mykey.bin.enc

Tested decryption with:
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in task4_decrypted_message.txt.enc -out test_decryption.txt -pass file:./mykey.bin
It was successful.

Realized I named it task4_decrypted_message.txt.enc and renamed it to task4_message.txt.enc, rechecked the decryption and it still worked.
--------------------------------------------------------------
To decrypt my encryption:
I'm giving you both the public, private, and encrypted random key since I wasn't sure which ones you meant by "both" and since you gave us the key.bin.enc to decrypt yours.

If your intention was to get the public key from the private key you can hopefully do that with:
openssl rsa -in my_private.pem -out my_public.pem -outform PEM -pubout
with pass phrase: mushi

Get the decryption key with:
openssl rsautl -decrypt -inkey my_private.pem -in mykey.bin.enc -out mykey.bin

Decrypt with:
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -in task4_message.txt.enc -out task4_message_decrypted.txt -pass file:./mykey.bin
