Homework 2: Cryptography - 2/18/19
-----------------------------------------------------
After attempting to use the task5_public.pem to verify the file for a good hour, looking up the problem on stack overflow and found that it was actually a certificate...
I got the public key from the certificate:
openssl x509 -pubkey -noout -in task5_public.pem >task5_actual_pubkey.pem

Using the actual public key to verify messages:
openssl dgst -verify task5_actual_pubkey.pem -signature task5_message_sig.sha256 task5_message3.txt
Checking each of the messages I found message3 was the one verified succefully

I signed the file with my private key:
openssl dgst -sha256 -sign my_private.pem -out task5.sig task5_message3.txt
pass phrase: mushi

Verified my own signiture with:
openssl dgst -verify my_public.pem -signature task5.sig task5_message3.txt
It was succesfully verified
