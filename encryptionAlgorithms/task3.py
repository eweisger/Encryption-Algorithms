#Program which implements the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman key exchange
#Using the parameters G = (5, 1), p = 17, a = 2, b = 2, n = 19, we asume Bob has beta = 2 as his secret number and alice has alpha = 18 as her secret number
#The program calculates the point B as beta*G and A as aplha*G, and shows that using either beta*A or alpha*B it results in the same point P
#Then, we use the x-cord of P as the multiplier and y-cord of P as the offset and use the affine cipher from task2 to decrypt the the task3 encrypted message
#Equations were taken from the video on the Elliptic Curve Diffie Hellman exchange, and stack overflow and man pages were referenced
